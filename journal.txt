Abstract

Dislocation interaction with hydrogen 

Introduction:

Hydrogen embrittlement is a crucial issue for nickel-based superalloys. The current lack of mechanistic understanding hamper the development of new alloys (Z. Zhang 2016). Recent studies suggest that dislocation hydrogen interaction plays a key role in hydrogen embrittlement of nickel based superalloys (J. Li 2017). 

Experimental:

Transmission electron microscope was used to characterise the nano-voids in the alloys caused by dislocation hydrogne interaction.

Results:

MD simulation in Fig.1 shows the edge dislocation interaction with hydrogen. It shows that H pin dislocations at hight strain rate. H was transported by dislocations at slow strain rate. 

Methodology:

We use various characterisation technique like SEM, EBSD, TEM. The insturemtns were described in Green et al 2010. 

Conclusions:

We gained valuable insight into the H induced embrittlement of nickel based superalloys.
